# Double-ended-queue-Deque-
Welcome to the Deque with Sentinel Node repository! This project showcases a robust implementation of a double-ended queue (deque) using a sentinel node in Java. The use of a sentinel node simplifies the management of edge cases and ensures efficient operations for adding and removing elements from both ends of the deque.
